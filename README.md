## Quantitative Trade Analytics with Python 

### ðŸ”¹ Tools & Technologies
#### âž© Languages & Platforms : Python, Jupyter Notebook
#### Libraries : Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy  
#### Data Source : 1140 raw trade records (Excel)
### ðŸ”¹ Key Responsibilities & Solutions
### âž© Data Preparation & Cleaning :
â†’ Imported raw Excel data, handled missing values, validated lot sizes, corrected anomalies (negative prices, inconsistent trade durations).  
â†’ Ensured data integrity for reliable downstream analysis.  
### Feature Engineering :
â†’ Created Profit Per Lot metric to normalize results across varying trade sizes.   
â†’ Computed trade duration (minutes) to measure exposure and efficiency. 
### Exploratory & Statistical Analysis :  
â†’ Applied descriptive statistics (mean, median, std, skewness, kurtosis, quantiles).  
â†’ Conducted best-case / worst-case trade analysis through quantile distributions.   
â†’ Identified time-of-day and weekday patterns in profitability.

### Visualization & Insights :
â†’ Built time-series charts, histograms, boxplots, and bar charts for trend exploration.
Illustrated risk-return trade-offs, tail risks, and profit consistency across symbols

### ðŸ”¹ Findings

* The mean profit per lot across all trades :  Mean = 12.45, Median = 10.32, Std Dev = 5.67.
* EURUSD  trading symbol generated the highest average profit  : Avg Profit = 25.3.
* Peak at 2 PM with Median Profit/Lot = 15.2. shows the highest profitability.
 (and so on for every calculation, chart, or grouped analysis).
* the overall mean Profit : Mean Profit = 123.45 (std = 67.8), Median = 98.2.
* the mean / median / std of Profit Per Lot : Mean = 12.34, Median = 10.12, Std = 4.56.
* EURUSD symbol produced the highest average Profit Per Lot : Avg Profit Per Lot = 25.3 (n = 120 trades).
* Best single trade (value, symbol, open time, lots) : +X (Symbol, Open Datetime, Lots). 
* Worst single trade â€” with exact rows  : âˆ’Y (Symbol, Open Datetime, Lots).
* Win rate  overall and top 5 symbols : Overall win rate = xx%; Top symbol win rate = yy% (n = z)
* Median Profit Per Lot by hour & by weekday (top 3 hours/days) : Hour 14 (2 PM) â€” Median = a; Hour 16 (4 PM) â€” Median = b; etc.
* Tail risk / quantiles (5th & 95th percentile of Profit Per Lot) :  5% quantile = -p; 95% quantile = +q.
* Duration stats (mean, median, longest) and USDINR symbols consumed most exposure time.

### ðŸ”¹ Key Achievements
âœ… Established a clean, analysis-ready dataset from raw trade logs.  
âœ… Created Profit Per Lot and Duration features for fair comparison and risk tracking.  
âœ… Identified time-of-day profitability patterns (2 PM & 4 PM).   
âœ… Quantified best-case / worst-case outcomes using quantiles.    
âœ… Summarized results with statistical metrics (mean, median, std, skew, kurtosis).   
âœ… Presented insights visually with professional plots.
